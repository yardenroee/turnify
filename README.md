# Turnify

Turnify was inspired by Spotify, a music streaming service allowing users stream music, search for artists and albums, create playlists, and follow other users.

 ## Technologies Used
 * Fraudify was created with Rails on the backend using a PostgreSQL database and React/Redux on the frontend.
 * Images and MP3 files were stored on AWS S3, increasing scalability
 * The loading time of the app was optimized through jBuilder and Rails' Active Storage. Fewer interactions with the database     helps increase user experience.
